Love your parents. We are too busy growing up yet we forget that they are already growing old
The moment you think about giving up,think of the reason why you held on so long
Total umbrella for someone else if he, you're just not for him in the rain.
Hold my hand,you won't get lost even with eyes closed.
We never really grow up. We only learn how to act in public.
Each trauma, is another kind of maturity.
Fortune favours the brave
Never put your happiness in someone else’s hands.
Sometimes you have to give up on someone in order to respect yourself
There is a time in life that is full of uneasiness.We have no other choice but to face it.
Being singl means you're strong and patient enough to wait for someone who deserves your worth.
The more you care, the more you have to lose.
One of the best things in life is seeing a smile on a person’s face and knowing that you put it there
No matter how bad your life may seem in the moment, it will always get better
Sometimes, it is better to turn around and leave than to insist on and pretend to be well.
Patience with family is love, Patience with others is respect, Patience with self is confidence.
Sometimes, the most painful not lose, but get later not happy.
For those things i don't talk about,it does not mean i don't know.
